                <h2>Social Media Management<br/><span class="color-accent">For Every Type of Brand</span></h2>
                <p>Over time, I have organically grown my Instagram account to 8.000+ followers and successfully created a supportive and positive online community. Now, I want to help others achieve the same. Through my social media consultations, I will work with each client, understanding their individual needs, market, and creativity, and help them develop a social media strategy to meet their desired results. We will meet for two hours per week to discuss the plans from beginning to end. I aim to teach others how to achieve sustainable growth and success on social media, ultimately leading to increased exposure and long-term career development. </p>
